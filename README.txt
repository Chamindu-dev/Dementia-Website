NeuroScan AI - Dementia Detection Research Project
==================================================

How to Run:
-----------
1. Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
2. No installation or server (Node.js/Python) is required.
3. This is a frontend prototype demonstrating the user interface.

Features:
---------
- Modern, "Glassmorphism" UI design.
- Simulated MRI Deep Learning Analysis.
- Interactive File Upload with Drag & Drop.
- Dynamic Results Dashboard with Confidence Scores.
- Responsive design for specific devices.

Note:
-----
Since this is a client-side demo, the "Analysis" is a simulation. 
In a real deployment, you would connect the `simulateAnalysis` function in `app.js` to a Python backend (Flask/Django/FastAPI) serving your Deep Learning model.
